* Introduction
- This org-mode file lists tasks for making a family of recommenders for jobs and job-related taxonomy tags and related dashboards.
- The purpose of this project is demonstrate different recommender workflows over jobs data.
- The jobs data is taken from :
  - https://data.world/promptcloud/us-jobs-on-dice-com
  - 22,000 jobs
